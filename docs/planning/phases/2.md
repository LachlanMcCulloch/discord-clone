### **Phase 2: Servers & Channels (Structure Only)** 🏗️

_User Stories: #4, #6, #7, #8_

**Backend:**

- Server CRUD operations (create, list user's servers)
- Channel CRUD operations (create, list server's channels)
- Membership tracking in DynamoDB
- Lambda handlers for all server/channel operations

**Frontend:**

- Server sidebar (list of servers)
- Channel list within selected server
- Create server modal
- Create channel modal
- Navigation between servers/channels
- Empty state when no messages

**Tests:**

- E2E: Create server → Create channel → Navigate between servers/channels

**Deliverable:** Users can create servers/channels and navigate between them (no messaging yet)
