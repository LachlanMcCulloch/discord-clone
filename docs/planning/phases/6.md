### **Phase 6: Message Management** ✏️

_User Stories: #14, #15_

**Backend:**

- `PATCH /messages/:id` (edit message - verify ownership)
- `DELETE /messages/:id` (soft delete with tombstone or hard delete)
- Broadcast edits/deletes via WebSocket to all channel members

**Frontend:**

- Edit button on own messages (show on hover)
- Delete button on own messages (show on hover)
- Inline editing or modal
- Show "(edited)" timestamp indicator
- Show deleted message placeholder: "_Message deleted_"

**Tests:**

- E2E: Send message → Edit → Verify change → Delete → Verify removal

**Deliverable:** Users can edit/delete their own messages
