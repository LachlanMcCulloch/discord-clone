### **Phase 8: Server Management** 🛠️

_User Stories: #18, #19, #20_

**Backend:**

- Track server owner in DynamoDB (ownerId field)
- `DELETE /channels/:id` (verify requester is server owner)
- `DELETE /servers/:serverId/members/:userId` (leave server - can't leave if owner)
- Cleanup: remove user from presence, memberships

**Frontend:**

- Show "Owner" badge in member list
- Delete channel option (visible only to owners)
- "Leave Server" button in server settings
- Confirmation modals for destructive actions
- Transfer ownership UI (optional - or prevent owner from leaving)

**Tests:**

- E2E: Create server → Create channel → Delete channel → Leave server

**Deliverable:** Server owners can manage servers, users can leave
