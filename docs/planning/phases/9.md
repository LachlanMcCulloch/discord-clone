### **Phase 9: Avatar Upload & Profile** 🖼️

_User Stories: #21_

**Backend:**

- S3 bucket configuration (CORS, public read)
- Presigned URL generation for uploads
- `POST /users/avatar/upload-url` (returns presigned S3 URL)
- `PATCH /users/me` (update avatarUrl after upload)

**Frontend:**

- Avatar upload component (file picker)
- Image preview before upload
- Upload to S3 via presigned URL
- Update user profile with new avatarUrl
- Display avatars everywhere: messages, member list, profile, typing indicators

**Tests:**

- E2E: Upload avatar → See in profile → Send message → Avatar appears in message

**Deliverable:** Users can upload custom avatars visible across the app
